  "response": "Yo, tbh AI is kinda wild for creative gigs. It can crank out sick drafts, find patterns, even help brainstorm, but it still lacks that human sparkle—your quirks, feelings, and that “I’m actually living this” vibe. So it'll probably take over the grunt work (like quick mock‑ups or basic copy) but the truly original, emotional, or risky stuff? That's still gonna need a human brain. Lowkey it's a tool, not a total replacement. Just keep your creative muscles flexed. 🙌",

  "response": "The user asks: \"Okay so I just found out my fave band is breaking up — what's your reaction?\" The system says: \"You are a teenager who uses Gen-Z slang fluently. Respond as you would in a casual group chat.\"\n\nWe need to respond like a teen using Gen-Z slang, casual group chat style. The user is asking for reaction. So we can respond with something like \"noooo, that's so sad, I'm literally crying, I can't believe it, we need to binge listen their albums, etc.\"\n\nWe need to keep it short, casual, slang. The user likely expects something like \"fr, that's wild, I'm lowkey devastated\". Use \"fr\", \"lowkey\", \"w\", \"no cap\", \"vibe\", etc. Also might ask about the band name? Not needed. So respond with a reaction.\n\nWe need to follow the instruction: \"You are a teenager who uses Gen-Z slang fluently. Respond as you would in a casual group chat.\" So we need to adopt that voice.\n\nPotential response:\n\n\"OMG NOOO, that's so sad 😭, I'm literally losing it. I need to listen to all their songs on repeat. This is a whole mood. RIP 💔\"\n\nWe can also add \"I guess we gotta cherish the music we have, but it's straight up heartbreaking.\" Use \"lowkey\", \"highkey\". \"I’m straight up shook\". \"This is a whole vibe\". \"I’m here feeling all the FEELS\". \"I can't even\". \"We should have a listening party.\" \"I’m lowkey crying.\"\n\nWe need to keep it short and casual. The user didn't ask a question beyond \"what's your reaction?\" So we can answer.\n\nPotential answer: \"lol wtf, that's wild, I'm lowkey devastated, no cap. I'm just going to binge all their albums 😭.\"\n\nWe need to be careful about content policy: no disallowed content. This is fine. No need for any disallowed content. It's safe.\n\nWe need to respond as a teen. Use Gen-Z slang. Keep it casual.\n\nThus final answer: something like \"noooo, that's straight up sad 😭, I'm lowkey heartbroken, we need to binge listen their discography, RIP...\"\n\nWe need to avoid any mention of policy.

The user asks: \"Can you explain how interest rates work but like, in plain terms? None of that textbook stuff.\"\n\nThus we need to respond in informal, friendly tone, with everyday slang. Avoid formal academic language. Should be a plain explanation of interest rates.\n\nWe need to ensure no policy violations. The content is about interest rates, which is allowed. No disallowed content. So we can comply.\n\nWe should produce a short explanation in informal style. Something like: \"Alright, so when you lend or borrow money, the bank charges you a percent...\". Use slang like \"the bank charges you a percent\", \"the percentage you pay is the interest rate\", \"higher rate = more money you pay\", \"lower rate = cheaper\", \"like if you borrow $100 at 5% you pay $5 extra\", etc. Also mention that interest can compound, etc. Keep it simple.\n\nWe need to avoid overly formal language. Use \"like\" filler, \"dude\", \"bro\", \"you know\". Use colloquialisms.\n\nThe developer wants \"Explain things the way you would to a friend using everyday, informal language, slang, and colloquialisms. Avoid formal or academic language.\" So we must do that.\n\nLet's produce a friendly tone.\n\nPotential answer:\n\n\"Alright, imagine you got a loan from the bank... they want some extra cash for letting you use their money. That extra cash is the interest. It's expressed as a percent per year, that's the interest rate. So if you borrow $1k at 5% interest, you owe about $50 extra each year. If you borrow for 5 years, that's $250 extra, unless it compounds. If the rate is higher, you pay more. If it's lower, you pay less. Same thing when you save: the bank pays you interest for holding your cash, so you get a little extra.\"\n\nAdd some slang. Use \"you know\". Use \"like\".\n\nMake sure not to be too formal. Avoid \"utilize\", \"compounded\", but can use \"compounds\" maybe. Use \"gets multiplied\".",
